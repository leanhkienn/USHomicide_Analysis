# Homicide/Assault Data Analysis from CDC Wonders Database
- This project involves the analysis and visualization of homicide and assault data from the CDC Wonders Database. The dataset contains information about gender, year,       state, and crude rate (deaths per 100,000 people) from 1999 to 2022.

# Data Source
 - The data used in this analysis was obtained from the CDC Wonders Database. The data was downloaded in a CSV format and imported into R for analysis.
 
# Tools Used
  Python: Data cleaning and pre-processing (libraries: Pandas, Numpy)
  RStudio: Statistical analysis and data visualization (libraries: tidyverse, ggplot2, dplyr, knitr, plotly, DT)


# Data Cleaning and Preparation
 - Before conducting any analysis, the data was cleaned and prepared. This involved removing missing values, renaming columns, and formatting the data. The cleaned data was then used for further analysis and visualization.

# Data Analysis and Visualization
 - Several graphs were created to visualize the trends in homicide and assault data over time. The following graphs were created:

    Total number of homicides per year across all states, broken down by gender
    Total number of assaults per year across all states, broken down by gender
    Maternal mortality rate by state and year
    Maternal mortality rate by state and year, broken down by race
    Maternal mortality rate by state and year, broken down by age group
    Maternal mortality rate by state and year, broken down by cause of death
    Homicide and assault data broken down by gender, year, and state

# Conclusion
- Through the data analysis and visualization, several trends and patterns were identified. It was observed that there is a consistent and significant gender disparity in both homicide and assault rates. Maternal mortality rates also varied widely by state, race, age group, and cause of death. The findings from this analysis can be used to inform policies and interventions aimed at reducing violence and improving maternal health outcomes.
